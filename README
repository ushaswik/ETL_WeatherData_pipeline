# ETL Weather Data Pipeline

## Overview
This **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline retrieves weather data from an external API, processes the data, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline is designed to handle raw JSON data and transform it into a clean, structured format using Python, specifically leveraging **Pandas** for data manipulation. Once transformed, the data is loaded into a PostgreSQL database where it can be queried and analyzed for further insights.

## Features
- **Extract**: Fetches data from a weather API in JSON format.
- **Transform**: Converts the JSON data into a structured DataFrame using Python and **Pandas**.
- **Load**: Inserts the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database for analysis and querying.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For transforming JSON data into DataFrame.
- **Requests**: To fetch data from the weather API.
- **PostgreSQL**: To store the transformed data.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Used for seamless integration between Python and PostgreSQL.
